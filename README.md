# React Components Lab

## Objectives

1. Practice writing React components
2. Practice rendering React components into the DOM

## Overview

After the reading, students should be reasonably familiar with writing and
rendering React components. Be sure to test both `createClass()` and ES6
`class`-based implementations (with maybe a slight preference for the latter.)
